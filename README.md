# THOR
ICDM 2022: THOR: Self-Supervised Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding via Three-Tower Graph Convolutional Networks

Way to preprocess dataset
1. cd data
2. python data.py
3. python construct_graph.py

Just for training ICEWS14 right away
1. python train.py

Test model trained with ICEWS14
1. check best epoch via printed output
2. python test.py

Thank you
